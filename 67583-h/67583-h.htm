<p>I wish to express my gratitude to Albert Lewis, who directed and
produced “The Jazz Singer” and who, in the long hours of many days and
nights, gave values to the play and stage wisdom to me which I hope
never to forget; to Stuart Sherman, who encouraged me when my faith
lagged; and to the members of the cast, especially George Jessel and
Sam Jaffe, for the many happy touches they have contributed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="pref"><i>PREFACE</i></h2>
</div>


<p>American life, in this year 1925, consists essentially of surfaces.
You may point out New England communities and say here is depth, and
I will answer, true, but New England is dead so far as the America of
now is concerned. You may show me an integrity in the West where a
century ago pioneers came, and I will answer, that integrity resides
with the elders and not with the mightier young ones. He who wishes to
picture today’s America must do it kaleidoscopically; he must show you
a vivid contrast of surfaces, raucous, sentimental, egoistical, vulgar,
ineffably busy—surfaces whirling in a dance which sometimes is a dance
to Aphrodite and more frequently a dance to Jehovah.</p>

<p>In seeking a symbol of the vital chaos of America’s soul, I find
no more adequate one than jazz. Here you have the rhythm of frenzy
staggering against a symphonic background—a background composed of
lewdness, heart’s delight, soul-racked madness, monumental boldness,
exquisite humility, but principally prayer.</p>

<p>I hear jazz, and I am given a vision of cathedrals and temples
collapsing and, silhouetted against the setting sun, a solitary figure,
a lost soul, dancing grotesquely on the ruins.... Thus do I see the
jazz singer.</p>

<p>Jazz is prayer. It is too passionate to be anything else. It is prayer
distorted, sick, unconscious of its destination. The singer of jazz
is what Matthew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span> Arnold said of the Jew, “lost between two worlds,
one dead, the other powerless to be born.” In this, my first play, I
have tried to crystallize the ironic truth that one of the Americas of
1925—that one which packs to overflowing our cabarets, musical revues
and dance halls—is praying with a fervor as intense as that of the
America which goes sedately to church and synagogue. The jazz American
is different from the dancing dervish, from the Zulu medicine man, from
the negro evangelist only in that he doesn’t know he is praying.</p>

<p>I have used a Jewish youth as my protagonist because the Jews are
determining the nature and scope of jazz more than any other race—more
than the negroes, from whom they have stolen jazz and given it a new
color and meaning. Jazz is Irving Berlin, Al Jolson, George Gershwin,
Sophie Tucker. These are Jews with their roots in the synagogue. And
these are expressing in evangelical terms the nature of our chaos today.</p>

<p>You find the soul of a people in the songs they sing. You find the
meaning of the songs in the souls of the minstrels who create and
interpret them. In “The Jazz Singer” I have attempted an exploration of
the soul of one of these minstrels.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene:</span> <i>It is the flat of Cantor Rabinowitz in the heart of the
East Side of New York. We see a rather large living room with a
curious mixture of furniture and crockery. The Cantor lives in
better style than most of his neighbors. The furniture is massive,
elaborate, of fine wood, the kind of furniture a wealthy Jew in Russia
would be likely to have. Everywhere there are shelves loaded with
bric-a-brac—china, glassware and silver.</i></p>

<p><i>There are two windows through which can be seen the stained glass
windows of the synagogue next door. There is a phonograph, a sideboard,
a settee, a bookcase, a Morris chair. On the wall are pictures,
including one of an old-fashioned Russian Jew, one of the Cantor, one
cheap chromo showing some kittens, and the framed citizen papers of the
Cantor.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">At rise:</span> <i>Before the curtain rises we hear a boyish treble sweetly
singing an old Hebrew cantor tune. As the curtain rises, we see little
Moey and the Cantor seated at the table. The Cantor is a lean man of
medium height. He has a neatly trimmed, grayish beard and is wearing
a skull-cap. His face is wrinkled, gentle, austere. He is a holy man
among a humane<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span> people—and all which that implies. He knows the ways
of kindliness, but the spirit in him is stern with following the God of
Vengeance for sixty years.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moey</span> <i>is singing.</i></p>


<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>[<i>Stops him</i>]. No, no, no! Didn’t I tell you how you should sing it?
Sing it with a sigh. Do you understand, my child? With a sigh! You are
praying to God. Nu, try it again. [<span class="smcap">Moey</span> <i>tries again, and again is
stopped by</i> <span class="smcap">Cantor</span>.] No—do you understand what it means, them words you
are singing? What does “Vaanee Sefeelosee” mean?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Moey</p>

<p>It means, “I, my prayer.”</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>And what means “Lecho Adoshem”?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Moey</p>

<p>That means, “To you, O God.”</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>Good! And what does it mean, “Ais Rutzon Elohim”?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Moey</p>

<p>“When you are ready, O God.”</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>That’s right. You’re a smart boy, Moey. Now what does it mean “Berov
Chasdecho Aneni Be-emes Yishecho”?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span> </p>

<p class="cast_role">Moey</p>

<p>[<i>Hesitates</i>]. I don’t know what that means.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>Is <em>that</em> nice? A smart boy like you what has the most beautiful
voice in the choir? You will never learn to sing until you know what
the words mean. Now, listen, Moey. This is what it means. “I offer
my prayer to you, when you are ready, O God, with your multitudes of
benedictions—answer me, O God, with truth, and help me.” Sing it again,
Moey. [<span class="smcap">Moey</span> <i>begins to sing again. The</i> <span class="smcap">Cantor</span> <i>rises, impatiently. He
is irritated with</i> <span class="smcap">Moey</span>, <i>yet he has forgotten the child. He speaks
more to himself than to</i> <span class="smcap">Moey</span>.] No, no! Oh, I wish I had my Jakie here.
He could show you how to sing it. The words he understood even when he
was a little boy smaller than you. And a voice he had like an angel.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Moey</p>

<p>Why did Jakie run away from home?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>[<i>Pause</i>]. Who said.... Where did you heard that?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Moey</p>

<p>Gee, everybody knows that ... all the boys in the choir....</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>Sometimes little boys know too much, Moey. Sometimes little boys think
they know more than their papas.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Moey</p>

<p>[<i>Rises</i>]. I’m hungry. Can I go home now, Cantor? My mama told me to
come home early tonight for supper.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>You shouldn’t speak from supper, Moey, when we are speaking from God.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Moey</p>

<p>Can I help it? I’m hungry.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>[<i>Craftily</i>]. In the kitchen we got nice cookies.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Moey</p>

<p>Cookies? What kind?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>With raisins in them.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Moey</p>

<p>Oh, I like them. Can I have some?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>Certainly, my child, but sing first.</p>

<p>Yes, go my child. I’ll keep a whole lot of cookies warm for you.</p>

<p>He’s a willing boy, Sara, and it’s a pleasure to hear him singing in
the choir. And his papa, peace be with him, was a rabbi. Maybe from
Moey I can make yet a Cantor.... Yes.... [<i>Sits.</i>] From him I will make
a great Cantor.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>[<i>Casually, with a prosaic little sigh</i>]. It seems like yesterday our
Jakie was standing the same way—a little boy—a darling—and you was
learning him to sing.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>Sara, I asked you a thousand times, don’t speak his name in my house.
You know what it does to me.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>I heard you from the kitchen—you spoke it yourself to Moey.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>Well, Moey and me—we was singing and—well, I made a mistake.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>A mistake? A papa should speak from his only son one time in five
years—that’s a mistake?</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>It’s so long since I found a boy with a voice like Moey.... I forgot
myself.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>Our Jakie had a voice even more beautifuller—even before he ran away—</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>Sara, please—it ain’t good that we should think too much about that
boy. He didn’t think of us.... God knows if he’s maybe now in jail or
not.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>How can you speak like this from your only child? I tell you he’s a
good boy and he ain’t in jail. In the last letter he wrote, he said....</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>I don’t want to know from his letters.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>But he’s got a good steady job. In Chicago.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>What’s the matter with you today? Maybe <em>you</em> could forget what he
done. I can’t.... [<i>Until now the mood has been conversational,

not? Everybody<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span> waiting to hear the Cantor’s son sing. And where was
he?... You said he would come back. It’s already five years now....
Where is he?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>I can’t help it the way I talk, Yosele. I feel lonely every day for our
Jakie.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>And you think I don’t! Please, don’t speak no more.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>All right, all right. I won’t speak no more.... But he’s got a steady
job. He’s making money.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>[<i>Bitterly</i>]. Money! Money! That’s all they know. A little less money

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>Well, it’s the Cantor’s birthday, so—</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>Sh! It’s a surprise. The Cantor is asleep.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>[<i>Lowers his voice</i>]. Oh, a surprise!... So I says to myself,
“Yudelson,” I says, “what should I give the Cantor that would be nicer
than a roast turkey, a gallon of wine which my wife, Olov Hasholem,
she made it five years before she died, and a genu-ine woolen praying
shawl!”</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>A praying shawl! How did you know about the birthday?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>How did I know! What’s the matter with you, am I crazy? The whole East
Side remembers it.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>[<i>Takes turkey and wine into kitchen</i>]. Sometimes I myself don’t
remember. I ain’t a young woman no more, Mr. Yudelson. I got so much
to do, I don’t realize that one day is Monday and all of a sudden it’s
Friday and I have to prepare for the Sabbath. I’m surprised that I
myself should remember the Cantor’s birthday. [<i>She folds the praying
shawl and puts it away.</i>]</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>You think only downtown knows about it? Uptown knows about it too. Mr.
Hymie Goldstein—if he’s worth a nickel, he’s worth a hundred thousand
dollars, all in first mortgages too!—he came in my store today and he
bought a gold watch. A new one. For cash. He bought it for the Cantor a
present—I should live so! He’s coming here tonight.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>[<i>Pleased</i>]. It’s nice he should remember the Cantor.... Lawyer Adler
just telephoned me on the telephone. He’s coming too tonight.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>Lawyer Adler! He’s already one of the big ones on Wall Street. Maybe
you can get him he should fix us a new balcony for the synagogue.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>[<i>Moving about the house, getting dinner ready</i>]. From Lawyer Adler we
could get anything. The Cantor loves him and he loves the Cantor. They
knew each other twenty years ago. What am I talking? It’s thirty years
if it’s a day. The way time flies! It seems like yesterday I was a
girl. [<i>She goes out to get table cloth.</i>]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>I bet you the Cantor don’t even know it’s his birthday. [<i>He sits down
at table.</i>]</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>[<i>Enters with table cloth</i>]. He never knows. Tell him this year,
tell him last year, he don’t remember. But when it comes, and I
remember—[<i>She raises</i> <span class="smcap">Yudelson</span>’s <i>hand as she spreads the cloth.</i>] and
his friends remember—oh, he loves it, believe me!</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>Did I told you what the Gershons are bringing the Cantor?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>The Gershons?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>You remember all the pictures which are hanging in the Committee Room
of the synagogue—the pictures of the Cantor’s father and grandfather
for four generations? Well, the Gershons made a hand painting from all
the pictures—</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>A hand painting?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>Yes, sir—with a fancy sign. It says on the sign: “Five Generations of
Great Cantors, and the Fifth Is the Best.”</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>[<i>Slowly</i>]. Five generations of great Cantors.... That will make him
think of Jakie.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>That’s right.... Would you believe it—even now I’m afraid to speak to
the Cantor about Jakie....<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span> Oh, it’s too bad. It’s too bad Jakie
can’t be here today, friends with his papa—to celebrate the birthday.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>[<i>Pause</i>]. You know, a letter came last week. I think it’s from Jakie,
because the Cantor didn’t want to open it.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>A letter from Jakie? Nu, you didn’t heard from him for a long time....
Why don’t <em>you</em> open it?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>I am afraid. I couldn’t tell you why, but I got a feeling in my heart
that in the letter it wouldn’t be good news. And it’s the Cantor’s
birthday.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>Don’t be foolish, Mrs. Rabinowitz. I’ll bet you it’s A Number 1 good
news. Give <em>me</em> the letter. <em>I’ll</em> read it.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>Maybe the Cantor wouldn’t like it.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>Come on, go ahead!</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>No, I can’t do it.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>Mrs. Rabinowitz—on my responsibility I’ll open it. Tell me, where is
the letter?</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>You shouldn’t open it—it’s on the top shelf. [<i>Points.</i>]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>[<i>Goes to sideboard</i>]. I’ve opened already a thousand letters in
my life. [<i>Takes letters, looks at them.</i>] No—that’s from the gas
company.... This must be from Jakie. [<i>Opens it quickly.</i>] You think
I should open it?—Well, all right. [<i>He begins reading, mumbling to
himself.</i> <span class="smcap">Sara</span> <i>sits at table,</i> <span class="smcap">Yudelson</span> <i>standing.</i>]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>If it’s bad news I don’t want to hear it. [<i>Pause.</i>] It’s bad news?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>[<i>To himself, painstakingly</i>]. “Chicago, August 2nd. My dear mother: I
am well and hope to hear the same from you.” [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Sara</span>.] He says he
is well, and give God to hear the same from you! [<i>Mumbles to himself
again.</i>] “I am coming to New York.” [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Sara</span>.] He says he is coming
to New York. [<i>To himself.</i>] “On the fourteenth.” [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Sara</span>.] On the

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>[<i>Sits at table</i>]. “My dear Mother—” No, I read this already. “I am
earning a great deal of money.” [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Sara</span>.] He says he is making
plenty money. [<i>Mumbles.</i>] “And I am getting a fine position.” [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Sara</span>.] He says he is getting a good job.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>Does he say what kind of a job?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>No, no.... “I send my love to you and to papa.” [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Sara</span>.] He sends
his love to you and papa.... [<i>To himself.</i>] “And the minute I arrive
in the city,—” [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Sara</span>.] And the minute he comes to the city, he
says—[<i>Looking at letter.</i>] And the minute he comes to the city, he
says—he says—“I will see you.” [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Sara</span>.] He will see you! [<i>To
himself.</i>] “From your son, who wishes you the best of everything,
Jakie.” [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Sara</span>.] From your son what wishes you what you wish

<p class="cast_role">Clarence</p>

<p>Only a big house and a dog she’s got? What does she do all the time in
the big house?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>She was born in the big house, Mama. Then she came to New York and
studied for the opera. But you know how it is in the opera. If a girl

four, five, six, ninety, a dollar ten, a dollar twenty. Stop when you

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Sure—certainly!</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>Real diamonds?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>If they’re not, Mama, somebody played me a dirty trick.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>Jakie, where did you get so much money?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Don’t worry about money, Ma. I got lots more where that came from.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</p>

<p>But what kind job could a young boy have that he should have so much
money?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Don’t worry, it’s all right, Ma. I didn’t kill anybody, and I’m not
selling real estate in Florida.</p>

<p>[<i>There is a pause. Then she turns gravely to her son</i>]. Jakie, tell
me—why did you run away that time?... Why didn’t you tell us?...</p>

Just like it always was.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>Jakie, you don’t get the headaches any more?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>No, Mama, I feel fine. I must weigh at least eight hundred pounds. Oh,
look, there’s Uncle Eli. [<i>Points to picture.</i>] He’s still mad! My,
look at that vase. It’s grown up! I remember it when it was a little
cup. And you’ve got a phonograph, too. I knew you were saving all those
soap wrappers for something. Um—so many new things—Oh, oh, I see a
change. [<i>Points<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span> to picture above phonograph.</i>] Didn’t there used
to be a picture of me there?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>[<i>Quickly</i>]. Yes, Jakie—we don’t have it no more. It fell down and got
broke—</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Well, well, well. First it was me, and now it’s pussy-cats! [<i>Moves to
window.</i>] But the synagogue—that’s still in the same place.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>[<i>Joins him</i>]. Sure, it’s in the same place, Jakie.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Do you know, Mama, it’s a funny thing. It looks so small to me now—and
when I was away on the road it used to seem so large—especially the
windows.... And now they look so small.... I remember that little
window away up in the corner—see the little blue window? Hm—I’ll never
forget, one day I was playing baseball. Hymie Cohen was pitching. I
hit a ball—it was a home run—and psst! went that window away up in the
corner.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>I’ll never forget how much it cost to fix it.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Well, we won’t talk about that. Can you still hear the services when
the window is open?</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>Yes, Jakie.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>[<i>Turns to phonograph</i>]. This is nice, Mama. Does it play, too?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>Sure it plays. It played last week.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Well, well, let’s see what kind of records you have. Um—Il Trovatore,
Pagliacci. You’re coming up in the world. Red Seal. That’s a buck and a
half. You haven’t got “Red Hot Mama,” have you?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>Red Hot Mama, what’s that?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>No home is complete without a red hot mama. If you had a piano in the
house, I’d show you.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>Sure, we’ve got a piano—since last year. Your papa uses it to teach the
choir. It’s in the front room.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay! A piano! You’ve been holding out on me. What’s been
going on for the last five years? The first thing you know, you’ll be
going to afternoon teas and dancing the Charleston.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>Go on, Jakie, I wouldn’t do that!</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>That’s the way they all start, Mama. What kind of a piano have you
got—grand or upright?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>I don’t know. We pay every month.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Then you’ve got an upright! Let’s go and see. [<i>They go out together.</i>]</p>

<p class="hindent2">[<i>From offstage is heard the rippling of some chords on the piano.

<p>No, Yosele. It was my fault. I wanted he should see the new piano.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>[<i>Gently, with quiet dignity</i>]. Wait a minute, Mama. I don’t think you
know how I feel now, Papa. I thought about you a thousand times when
I was away. The first place I came when I got off the train was home.
I didn’t mean any harm when I played the piano. I just wanted to sing
Mama a jazz song....</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>Jazz! A song of prayer wouldn’t come into your head, only jazz. Even
when you was a little boy, I taught you to sing to please God, but
you sang to please yourself. One minute you were singing in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>

You’re right, Papa. I am the same. You did teach me to sing songs of
prayer. And I sang them here for you. But when I got out on the street
with the other kids, I found myself singing the same songs they sang.
And they’re very much alike,—our songs—and the street songs. Well,

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>[<i>Almost hysterically</i>]. Where are you going to act, Jakie? Downtown
here?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>No, Mama. I’m going to act uptown. In English.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>What kind English acting are you doing uptown?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>[<i>Responding to his mother’s mute appeal</i>]. Come on, Pa, let’s
celebrate your birthday, and then some other time I’ll talk about my
work.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>Come, Yosele, look. See the diamonds what Jakie brought me. Ain’t that
nice? For a mama diamonds, and for a papa a praying shawl. Yosele, he’s
got in the satchel so many nice things. [<i>She moves toward the bag.</i>]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Now, please, Mama, he doesn’t want to see that.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>I’m asking you—what kind English acting you are doing uptown?</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>[<i>Takes out prayer book</i>]. Oh, see, Yosele! He’s still got his little
ivory prayer book what you gave him when he was confirmed.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>It’s a funny thing about that prayer book, Ma. When I was traveling on
the road, I bet I left a million things behind, but I always carried
that.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>See, Yosele, he didn’t forget he’s a son from a Cantor.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p class="smcap">What kind English acting are you doing uptown?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Papa, it’ll take some time to explain. It’s hard to tell you in a few
words. Can’t we wait until after a while—</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>It ain’t hard I should tell you the work I’m doing. I sing to God. I
pray. It ain’t hard to tell the kind work your mama is doing. She is
a Cantor’s wife. <em>She</em> worships the Almighty. <em>She</em> knows the sorrows
what has come to the descendants from Abraham and Isaac and Jacob,
to the children of Israel. <em>She</em> is living to be a good wife of a
Cantor.... Once she wanted to be a mother of a Cantor, too, but she
found this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span> couldn’t be. It ain’t hard for us to tell you the kind
of lives we are living. What kind of life are you living?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>[<i>Exasperated</i>]. I told you. I’m an actor. I sing. Just like you sing.
Only I sing in a theatre.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>[<i>Fearfully</i>]. What kind singing?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Didn’t you hear me? I sing jazz songs. Ragtime.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>[<i>Stunned</i>]. Mama, did you heard what he said?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>Jakie, you are fooling!</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>You’re right, Ma. I fool, too. I’m a comedian. I get all dressed up in
funny clothes. I sing funny songs and make people laugh. They pay money
to come and hear me. They’re going to pay big money soon. Right now,
Mama, I’ve got a big job with one of the biggest producers in New York
City, with a show called “The April Follies.” And if I make good, I’ll
get a big salary, and you’ll be proud of me—you’ll see.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>A joke maker! A jazz singer! Oh, my God in Heaven! Does it mean nothing
that Rabinowitz is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span> the name of great Cantors? Does it mean nothing
that there is a God?... You are no son of mine. I never want to see you
again.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>[<i>Hopelessly</i>]. All right, all right. [<i>Moves to settee, begins to pack
his bag.</i>]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>Jakie, tell him you are sorry. Tell him you are ashamed.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Ashamed—what have I got to be ashamed of? Shall I tell him I’m ashamed
because I worked like a slave to get my big opportunity? Did I come
home broke? Did I ask for anything? No. I came home because it looks
like I’m going to be successful, and I wanted to share it with you.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>I don’t want to share anything with you! Go back to your sidewalks!</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>[<i>As he packs his bag</i>]. All right, all right. You’re not giving
me a chance, that’s all. Why do you think I came home? I came home
because I want to have your love again—that’s why. I came home because
I thought I could bring together all the things in my life that are
dear to me, that made me happy from the time when I was a little kid
till now—singing and playing in the streets—the East Side—shooting
craps—baseball—my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span> mama—my papa—the synagogue,—and now my work in the
theatre.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>Don’t you mention the word synagogue in this house again!</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>Yosele, couldn’t you listen to him? Couldn’t you see he is trying to
tell you something?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>To such words if I listen God will burn me with lightning. Better I
should be dead than my son should holler unholy words in my ears! Get
out! Out from my house! You loafer from the sidewalks! You tramp! You
bum! You actor in a theatre!... You jazz singer! [<i>He is seized by
a fit of coughing, and he sinks into a chair.</i> <span class="smcap">Sara</span> <i>hastens to his
side.</i>]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>Jakie! The water! From the sideboard! [<span class="smcap">Jack</span> <i>goes quickly to sideboard,
pours a glass of water and brings it over.</i>] Yosele, you shouldn’t
excite yourself so. Look, Jakie, see how white your Papa’s face is.
[<i>Takes glass of water from</i> <span class="smcap">Jack</span>.] Here, Yosele, drink it slow. Jakie,
my son, come, tell him you are sorry. Tell him you are ashamed.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>How can I, Mama? If I can’t be proud of being a jazz singer, then I
can’t be proud of anything. It’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span> all I’ve got, Mama, it’s all I am.
[<i>Gets hat, stick and bag, then pauses.</i>] Well, there won’t be any more
arguments around here on my account, I’ll tell you that. I was away
for five years—I can stay away longer. I’m sorry if I did anything to
make you feel so bad, Papa. But you can make up your mind to this. I’m
a young fellow, and I’m going to live my life in my own way. I’m not
going to stay down here and sing prayers that don’t mean anything to me
any more. Maybe I could do it when I was a kid, but I’m not going to
do it now. I’m never going to do it. That’s all. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Sara</span> <i>in lower
voice.</i>] Well, I’m going to the hotel. I’ll call you up as soon as I
get settled. [<i>Goes to door.</i>] Goodbye, Mama. [<span class="smcap">Sara</span> <i>indicates</i> <span class="smcap">Cantor</span>
<i>sitting, broken, by the table.</i>] Goodbye, Papa.... I’m very sorry—I’m
very sorry that you just—don’t understand. [<i>He goes.</i>]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>[<i>Touches</i> <span class="smcap">Cantor</span> <i>on shoulder</i>]. He’s gone, Yosele. Our Jakie is gone.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>[<i>Without moving, head sunk on chest</i>]. Did you heard how he sang? The
same sighs, the same tears I taught him in the synagogue—that I put in
his voice he should sing to God—now he uses them to sing in his jazz
music. [<i>His hand on the table encounters the praying shawl which</i> <span class="smcap">Jack</span>
<i>brought.</i>] A fine birthday present I got. My son brought it to me. A
praying shawl from Palestine, from the dirty hands of a loafer.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</p>

<p>[<i>He rise.</i>] Burn it! [<i>He moves toward the settee.</i>] Put it in the
stove and burn it!</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>[<i>Goes to him</i>]. Oh, Yosele, you are breaking my heart when you speak
like this! And I tried to be so happy on your birthday!</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>[<i>Stares at her incredulously</i>]. Happy—happy? You are happy? You look
in my face and tell me happy you are?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>[<i>With a tragic attempt to smile</i>]. Sure! Look at me, ain’t my face
smiling? [<i>Sits beside</i> <span class="smcap">Cantor</span>.] Why shouldn’t I be happy? Ain’t it
today you are sixty years old?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Cantor</p>

<p>[<i>Doesn’t seem to hear; mutters</i>]. A surprise—that’s a fine surprise I

<h2 class="mt1_5 nobreak" id="act2"><i>ACT TWO</i></h2>
</div>

<h3><i>SCENE 1</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene 1:</span> <i>The stage of the Fulton Theatre, during the morning hours
just preceding the afternoon dress rehearsal of “April Follies.”</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">At rise:</span> <i>The curtain rises on a disorderly stage where a song and
comedy “number” is being rehearsed. We are looking at the stage from
the back—that is, we see directly into the footlights and into an empty
auditorium.</i></p>

<p><i>Stage hands are working, shifting scenery back and forth; electricians
are placing lamps and experimenting with lighting effects. As the
curtain rises we hear the banging of a piano. We see a chorus in
practice clothes. We see</i> <span class="smcap">Carter</span> <i>dancing.</i></p>

<p><i>In the back, at the footlights, Lee, the producer, sits in a tilted
chair, a manuscript in his hand. Grouped between</i> Lee <i>and the chorus,
on either side of</i> Carter, <i>are</i> <span class="smcap">Gene, Miss Glynn, Mary Dale, Jimmy</span>
<i>and another actor. Seated in the shadowy foreground, playing cards
with a stage-hand, is</i> <span class="smcap">Jack Robin</span>.</p>

<p><i>Most of the action in this scene is paced very swiftly. It gives the
effect of the hurried disorder which is characteristic of the eleventh
hour of a theatrical production. The action is almost frantic—one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
speech piles on top of another so that you can scarcely follow it. It
is not necessary that you follow it. The picture is enough. It is only
at certain moments—moments when the story of the play enters with its
deeper note—that the action is slow, that characters begin to come into
focus—such moments as when</i> <span class="smcap">Jack</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>are alone, when</i> <span class="smcap">Jack</span> <i>is
alone with</i> <span class="smcap">Lee</span>, <i>etc.</i></p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>That’s all right! Is everybody concerned in the Dixie scene here?</p>

<p>[<i>A tall, stout man, meticulously dressed. He has a black
mustache—probably dyed—and scant, grayish hair on an impressive bald
head. Adversity sent him to the theatre, where he made money. Money
sent him to Europe, where he achieved good clothes and an air of
distinction. He never allows his air of distinction to interfere with
efficiency, however; and, on the other hand, no matter how intense the
excitement and confusion of the rehearsal, he never takes his coat off.
He rises</i>]. Now, remember—this is the finale of the first act and I

<p>No, Carter, I’ve changed my mind about that. I’ve decided to let Jack
do that Poppy number in the second act.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Lee, that’s the best number I got. That’s where I do my

enough to do now.</p>

<p>[<i>Impatiently</i>]. That’s all right, Jack. I know that. Why do you think
I postponed the opening? In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span> order to give you more to do. You can
carry this number, too. Now continue the scene and go right into the
Dixie Number.</p>

<p>I’ve got an idea. We won’t use this stage again until the dress

to do it alone with no one on the stage. Just you and the spot light.
Cut out the running around and put your heart into it. Give it all

<p>Yes, Miss Glynn. I’ve been watching your work in the finale this

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>Well, you’re not. I don’t believe you ever had any stage experience in
your life. You dance like a school girl. Now answer my question. Did
you do any professional work before?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Miss Glynn</p>

<p>N—no—B—but I thought—</p>

Don’t blame this kid. Anything she slipped over on you was my fault.
She—well I saw her in the waiting room—and she looked kind of bashful,
poor kid—so I told her to tell you she had been in the “Follies.” I

<p>[<i>Slowly</i>]. I can’t get over the feeling that if I don’t make good
tonight, you’re going to be the goat. You and Mr. Lee. You’ve done
everything for me— the two of you. So far, I haven’t done a thing in

deep down here—[<i>He touches his heart.</i>]—if I flop. But then, that’s my
business and nobody else’s.... The way things are now, though.... Gee,
if I don’t make good with you—and with Lee—I’ll feel like hell.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>Is <em>that</em> all that’s worrying you? Why, Jack, how silly you are!
You’re going to be a sensational success, don’t you realize that? And
everybody’s going to be proud of you.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>[<i>Slowly</i>]. Not everybody. I know somebody who won’t be proud of me.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

never mentioned your people to me.</p>

<p>They’re far away. [<i>He rises from trunk.</i>] Oh, it’s no use to talk

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>You don’t know my father and mother, Mary.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>Jack, there’s nothing as selfish as the selfishness of parents. Do
you think my people liked the idea of my being on the stage? Mother
threatened to have a nervous collapse. Father was frantic. But I did
what I wanted, and they both got over it. And now they brag about me to
the rest of the family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>Everything, Jack. If it’s the right kind of a story. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Lee</span>.] You
know how Jack puts over a song. That intensity of his. Something like
the intensity of Billy Sunday. It’s a new note.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Forbes</p>

<p>Yes, and if I can weave a colorful life story behind it—based just a
little on fact—</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>All right. I’ll tell you. Say that every morning at eight o’clock I
take a bath in certified milk.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>Don’t waste any time kidding, Jack. Give Franklyn a general outline of
your life—where you were born, your parents, and so on.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>I—I’m sorry, Mr. Lee, but I’m kinda sensitive about my childhood. Not
that I’ve been in jail or anything like that. But why doesn’t Mr.
Forbes fake a story—I don’t care what he says—it’ll be O. K. with me.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Forbes</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>We can’t waste any more time on this. Write anything you want to,

<p>Now, please.... I don’t want you to think I am swell-headed.... I
appreciate the fact that you are all trying to help me. But look—isn’t
there enough in that Chicago stuff without going back to my cradle days?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>That’s not a bad idea. Franklyn, why don’t you use the story of how
Miss Dale discovered Jack?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>I’ll tell it to you, Franklyn. I was playing in Chicago—</p>

<p class="cast_role">Forbes</p>

<p>[<i>Takes out pad and pencil, sits at table</i>]. You were playing in
Chicago?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

Madison Street movie houses, and there he was.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>This won’t be any good either—</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Because after the opening night I’ll probably go back to Chicago—by
freight. And the old gang at the movie house will give me the laugh.
They’ll say, “Here he is—the great Jack Robin from Broadway! Hurray!
Catch a broom and sweep out the place!”</p>

<p class="cast_role">Forbes</p>

<p>What movie house was it, Miss Dale?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>I don’t know. What house was it, Jack?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Oh, a funny little place under an elevated station—called The Happy
Hour.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Forbes</p>

<p>What were you doing there?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>I was looking at Mary.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>Jack was standing in a spotlight—dressed in <em>such</em> clothes....</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>You ought to see the suit I had, Mr. Lee, for eighteen fifty, with nine
pair of pants!</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>And he was singing, “Take Me Back to Tennessee.” I never heard jazz
sung quite like that before. There was a tear in it. I came every day
that week. Jack did all sorts of things, comic songs, Mammy songs,
sold candy up and down the aisle, announced next week’s program—about
fourteen times a day.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Yeh, and I checked baby carriages, too! I did everything in that joint
except collect the money. They wouldn’t let me do that.</p>

<p>This jazz singer of yours, Jack Robin, and Mary’s interest in him.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>I thought we settled that a month ago.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Dillings</p>

<p>I’m afraid we didn’t. I’ve been thinking it over, and I’ve decided to
take my money out of your show.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

come here at the last moment like this and—</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Dillings</p>

<p>This wasn’t a business arrangement in the first place—and you know it.
I think you know that Mary and I were once engaged to be married. You
must realize that the only reason I put my money into this show was to
protect her interests. She means a great deal to me....</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>Her interests are the same today as they were a month ago. The fact
that she has discovered Jack and made me engage him does not alter
anything.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Dillings</p>

<p>[<i>Quietly, without malice</i>]. Well, I’ve learned differently. The thing
I was afraid of has happened. It was bound to happen sooner or later, I
suppose—an attachment of this sort.... Now, I’m no stage-door Johnny.
I have my limit, and I’ve reached it. Today I wash my hands of all
responsibility for Mary’s career. Be a good fellow and don’t let’s
argue the matter any more. Simply mail me a check today.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>You’re not taking him seriously, are you? Why, he’s just a harmless
kid—eager to get along—</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>Yes, but—</p>

<p class="cast_role">Dillings</p>

<p>I haven’t a thing against the boy. I wouldn’t know him if I saw him.

well not to understand that you’re acting, as usual, on principle.
And I know Harry too well to mind his blunt ways. Apparently what you
both want me to say is that Jack Robin doesn’t mean anything at all to
me and that I shan’t see him after this except as one sees a fellow
performer.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>[<i>With a hearty sigh of relief</i>]. Exactly!</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>Well, I can’t say it. I like Jack tremendously and expect to see more
of him than ever.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Dillings</p>

<p>I’m sorry this has happened.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>Harry, does this mean that you’re going to be in a terrible fix for
money?</p>

you up in this neighborhood?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>Jakie, I came to tell you your papa is sick.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>[<i>Site up straight</i>]. What’s the matter with him? Has he got a good
doctor?</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>The best doctor in New York. Dr. O’Shaughnessy from the Rockenfeller
Institute.... Jakie, my boy, tonight starts the Day of Atonement—Yom
Kippur—and this is the first time in your papa’s life what he wouldn’t
be able to sing in the synagogue on Yom Kippur. So we had a meeting
from the committee, who should sing in his place. Well, I was speaking
to your mama, and she thought it would be a beautiful surprise for your
papa if you would do it.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Me to sing? My God, Yudelson, he kicked me out of the house only a
month ago.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>Don’t be foolish, Jakie. How much times was you kicked out—one time? A
son could be kicked out twenty times, and yet a son is a son. If your
papa knew you was singing tonight, it would make him happy.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>But, Yudelson, I can’t do it!</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>Nonsense. I was telling the committee—you know how it is a
committee—they wanted Levy, the Shamus, should sing. But I’m the
chairman, and they all owe me money, so when they voted it was the way
your mama wanted. I told them, “Jakie, when he was a little boy and he
sang in the choir, his papa learned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span> him all the words of all the
prayers. And what a little boy learns he never forgets....” And even if
maybe a few words you should forget, you can look in the prayer book.
Jakie, you can do it! I got confidence in you! And your mama—she’ll be
the happiest—</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>But, Yudelson, this show opens tonight!</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>What’s the matter with you, Jakie? Ain’t I telling you your papa is
sick and your mama is waiting I should give her an answer?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>[<i>Slowly</i>]. Yudelson, the show business is different from anything
else. The finest actors keep right on working, even if there’s a death
in the family. The show must go on.... It’s like a religion.... It’s
like soldiers in an army....</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>[<i>Enters with</i> <span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>]. Now remember, Jimmy, I don’t want any strangers
on the stage during dress rehearsal. [<span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> <i>goes.</i>] Jack! I want to
see you.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Excuse me, this is Mr. Lee—my boss. Mr. Lee—gee, I don’t know how I can
explain this to you. Well—this is Mr. Yudelson, an old family friend.
He just told me that my father, down on the East Side, is very sick—</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>East Side?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>I held out on you, Mr. Lee, because my father and I had quarreled. I
thought he never wanted to see me again. It hurt me so much that I
wanted to start fresh, live a new life.... But now I find I didn’t
quite understand. My father is the Cantor of the Orchard Street
Synagogue. Tonight is the eve of the Day of Atonement. He and my mother
sent Mr. Yudelson to ask me to sing in my father’s place tonight. I
know all the prayers—</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>My dear boy, it’s out of the question.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Mr. Lee, isn’t there any possible chance?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>Only tonight and tomorrow until it gets dark.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>No, absolutely not. Why you’re the whole show. I’ve staked everything
on you.... Jack, I’m going to tell you something. I was an actor myself
once. My mother died one afternoon, but I went on that night....</p>

Something happened a while ago that puts me in a position where I’m
depending on you more than you know. Now, talk him out of it. [<i>He
goes.</i>]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>That’s your boss?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>[<i>After a moment of thought</i>]. Yes.... Yudelson, do you realize what
an awful lot of money is tied up in this show? It costs thousands and
thousands of dollars....</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>[<i>Impressed, the business man in him responding</i>]. Is <em>that</em> so!</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>The scenery ... the costumes ... and all the actors.... Mr. Lee is
responsible for everything—and he’s counting on me. You heard him—he’s
staking everything on me.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p><em>Is</em> that so?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Yudelson, you’re a business man ... now I ask you, how can I leave this
show ... on a big opening night ... just because my mama and papa all
of a sudden ... don’t you see?</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>Well, Jakie, if you can’t sing tonight, I’ll have to sit and listen to
that voice from Levy’s.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Levy—that’s the Sexton, isn’t it? I’ll bet he’s got a fine voice.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>Yeh, like a nanny goat! Nu, what can I do? I’ll explain to your mama
the best way I can.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Yes, try to explain to them, Yudelson.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>You’re sure you can’t come?</p>

<p>You’ve got the right hunch all right. Mary, Yudelson told me things

<p>Maybe it’s better that you <em>should</em> get me out of your mind. Maybe
it would be better if I got you out of <em>my</em> mind.... Since Yudelson

is the eve of the Day of Atonement—the most solemn Jewish holy day of
the year, the big day of every Cantor’s year. You know what a Cantor
is? He’s the mouthpiece of the congregation. He sings to God. My mother
sent Yudelson to ask me to sing in my father’s place. You don’t know
what it means to them. For five generations the Rabinowitzes have been
Cantors. The name Rabinowitz is like a trade mark on Orchard Street. No
substitutes will do....</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>What did you tell Mr. Yudelson?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>What could I tell him?... The most important part of the services will
be starting just about the time I have to go on the stage tonight.... I
told him no, that I wouldn’t miss this opening, not even for my father
and mother.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>[<i>Gravely</i>]. I am glad you said that, Jack.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Glad?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>Yes, my dear. You’ve got to think only of your work.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>I’ve tried so hard to do that, but ... Mary, here’s something I never
told anybody in my life.... Sometimes when I’m alone—and I’m alone a
lot more than you think—the old songs from the synagogue start wailing
in my ears ... and I—I cry.... In that hall bedroom in Chicago, I used
to get down on my knees in the dark and talk to God in Hebrew. I—bawled
him out ... because he made me only half a Cantor—half a Cantor, and
half a bum. [<i>He begins to black up.</i>] If I was all bum, I wouldn’t
care. What does a bum care? But if I was all Cantor, I would be happy.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>Would you?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>I think I would.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>Then why didn’t you go with Yudelson?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>[<i>As he blacks up</i>]. Why? You know why—people like you—like Lee. I’ve
got Broadway in my blood. There’s something sweet about the sound of
the English language in my ears.... I want to be part of America. I
want to take it in my arms.... Gee, I wish I could express myself!...</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>[<i>Understandingly</i>]. My dear, I think I realize what you’re going
through.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>No you don’t.... [<i>Intently.</i>] Mary, my father is sick because of me.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>[<i>Quickly</i>]. Nonsense.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>He said a month ago he never wanted to see me again. I can see him now,
eating his heart out ever since.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>[<i>Gently</i>]. What can you do about it? Go down on the East Side and be a
Cantor the rest of your life?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>No. [<i>Pause.</i>]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>Don’t you care about your career on the stage?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>[<i>Passionately</i>]. It’s the only thing in the world for me.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>The only thing?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Yes, the only thing.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>[<i>Slowly</i>]. More than me, Jack?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>More than you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>[<i>Swiftly, with feeling</i>]. That’s what I’ve been waiting to find out.
[<i>Music begins again off-stage.</i>] Oh, don’t you see, Jack—I don’t want
you selfishly. I want to see you live your own life. If the thing you
want most is to be a black-face minstrel, then don’t let <em>anything</em>
stand in your way—not your parents—me—anything....</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>[<i>He is finishing blacking up</i>]. I guess you’ve got the right idea,
Mary. You’re O. K. [<i>There is a knock on the door.</i>] Come in.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Gene</p>

<p>[<i>Enters</i>]. Time you’re ready for your first number, Mr. Robin.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>I’m almost ready now, Gene.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Gene</p>

<p>All right, Mr. Robin. [<i>He goes.</i>]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Hear that music? That’s that new fox-trot. [<i>Hums, crosses stage and
washes hands.</i>] It’s a steal from something.... Mary, you know, if
people only knew what it was to black up like this, I bet everybody
would do it. What’s the name of that bird that puts his head in the
ground and thinks he’s all covered up?</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>Ostrich?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Well, I feel like him with this black on. It covers your face and hides
everything.... You know, Mary, this would be a good job if I didn’t
have to buy so much soap. [<i>Crosses to make-up shelf. Another knock on
the door.</i>] Come in.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jimmy</p>

<p>[<i>Enters, leaving door wide open. Music swells until door closes</i>].
That man, Mr. Robin, the one who was here a while ago—he’s back. He
insists on seeing you at once.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>[<i>Visibly affected</i>]. It’s Yudelson.... Tell him he’ll have to wait
until after this number.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jimmy</p>

<p>There’s somebody with him—a lady.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>A lady?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>I’ll go, Jack. [<i>She starts.</i> <span class="smcap">Jack</span> <i>stops her.</i>]</p>

<p>[<i>In sudden agony</i>]. Yudelson, didn’t you tell my mama?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Yudelson</p>

<p>I told her everything, the same way you told me, Jakie, but she made me

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>[<i>In a monotone</i>]. Jakie, your papa is sick. He is laying in bed. His

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Mama, sit down, please.</p>

<p class="hindent2">[<i>All this happens very quickly. And now</i> <span class="smcap">Jack</span>, <i>for an instant, has

His face is white like a <i>yahrzeit</i> candle. He was saying, “Sara,” he
said—his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span> voice was so low, I could hardly hear him—“maybe Jakie
will sing tonight in the synagogue....”</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>[<i>Strangely touched</i>]. He really said that, Mama?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>He said it—the way I’m sitting here this minute, he said it.... For
five generations God always heard a Rabinowitz sing every Day of
Atonement, every holy day, every Sabbath. God is used to it now....
Maybe your papa is dying. God will ask him, Is Jakie singing in the
synagogue tonight? How can he say, No, he is singing in a theatre!...
Oh, my son, my heart is breaking in pieces.... You got two hours before
the sun goes out of the sky and it gets dark. Come with me home, Jakie.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>[<i>Despairingly, head sunk on his chest</i>]. Mama, I can’t. I can’t do it!</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>[<i>In a more intense monotone</i>]. How can you say this to me, your
mama?... When you was a little boy, we were so poor.... I slaved my
fingers to the bone that there should be money to buy you nice things.
My fingers, they used to bleed. Look at my hands, Jakie. It is still
there the marks.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

out.</i>]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>[<i>As if in a trance</i>]. Your papa said, “Ask Jakie he should forgive me.

a Rabinowitz”.... Jakie, the way I’m sitting here, before God I swear
it—that is what he said.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Don’t give me any more analysis. It gives me a headache.</p>

<p>It’s going to give you a much greater headache when the lawyers get
after you.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Lawyers?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>You know, my boy, you signed a pay-or-play contract. And you didn’t
sign it with me as an individual. You signed it with a corporation of
which I am the president. That corporation has stockholders. Those
stockholders vote....</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>When you hired me, did you have to ask the stockholders?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Then <em>fire</em> me without asking them.... [<i>He rises, drops into chair

about law.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

Mr. Lee. What can I do?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>I’ll tell you what you can do. You have one hour to get back to the
theatre and live up to your contract with me.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Why can’t you postpone the opening of the show?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>I postponed this show twice because of you. The owners of the theatre
have a show of their own they want to bring in. They’ll jump at this
opportunity to put me out.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Why don’t you get another theatre?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>At this time of the year? [<i>With sudden furious indignation.</i>] You’ve
got a lot of nerve, asking me that! Nobody ever did that much for me,
and I’ll be damned if I’ll do it for you!</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>You’re hard.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>You bet I’m hard. I’m in a hard business. It’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span> like being in an
army. The soft man gets licked. You’re soft—and you’re getting licked.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>[Raises his head]. Soft, because I’m giving up the biggest night of my
life to keep my mother’s heart from breaking? Soft, because I’m going
to pray in a synagogue so that my father can be proud of his family
name—so that my father may live?... You think it’s going to be easy
for me to stand there singing stuff that doesn’t mean anything to me
anymore and give up playing to a big Broadway opening night?... Soft
because I’m giving up the only girl I ever loved—</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>Giving her up?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Yes, giving her up. She’s like you. Hardened to the stage idea. She
thinks I’m soft, too—sentimental. Don’t you think I went through hell
before I came down here?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>[<i>Harshly</i>]. You’re kidding yourself. You really want to sing in a
Synagogue tonight. You’re getting a kick out of feeling like a martyr.
I’ve seen this sort of thing before. First-rate people don’t pull it.
If you were made of the stuff that succeeds, you, with your brains and

my business, and I did.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>Your papa and mama wouldn’t attend to <em>their</em> business if <em>you</em> should

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>My father and mother were on the stage all their lives, and I know they

<p>I’m sorry, Mrs. Rabinowitz, if I don’t seem to sympathize. But my

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>From business I don’t know. All I know is what is in my Jakie’s heart.
In his heart is love for his God and for his papa, and he wants tonight

You looked at Jakie. Couldn’t you see this in his eyes?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>Pardon me. [<i>At phone.</i>] Yes? Gene?</p>

<p>Gene, do everything just as I laid it out before I left. We positively
open tonight. Let Carter do all Robin’s scenes and numbers. He’ll do

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>Where is he? I’ve got to talk to him.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>What do you want to do with him?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>I’ve got to bring him back to his senses. He must not stay down here.
It would ruin his whole career.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>[<i>Thoughtfully</i>]. You can’t do anything with him.... Maybe you can with
his mother.... That’s why I stayed behind. I want to talk to her just
once more.... I want to convince her that he belongs to us, and not
down here.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>[<i>Sits, her voice deepens</i>]. Harry, have you met his mother?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>She’s real.... That’s why it took me so long to make up my mind. And
then I realized that if I could show her the truth—[<span class="smcap">Sara</span> <i>enters</i>]. How
do you do, Mrs. Rabinowitz?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>Hello, lady. Your name I don’t know, so excited I was in the theatre.
You came maybe you should hear Jakie sing tonight?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>Where is Jack, Mrs. Rabinowitz? I’d like to see him.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>Right now you couldn’t see him. He’s in the synagogue. He’s practising
with the choir. Open the window, and you could hear him just like you
was sitting there.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>Miss Dale wants to talk to Jack.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>[<i>Stops, looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Lee</span>]. Miss Dale is from you a friend?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>I’m a very good friend of Mr. Lee’s.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>If you are a good friend from him, then with Jakie you shouldn’t speak
tonight.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>I’m afraid you don’t understand. I’m a good friend of Mr. Lee’s, but
I’m also a very good friend of Jack’s.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>A good friend from Jakie’s would leave him alone tonight. I am Jakie’s
mama. Did I made him he should eat? No.... He wants he should practise
with the choir. So I let him go hungry. Sometimes love lets people go
hungry.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>I love Jack, too, Mrs. Rabinowitz—and that’s why I want him to go to
the theatre tonight.... It’s his one great opportunity. [<i>A pause.</i>]
You know, I found him.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>You found him?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>I recognized his ability—I helped him to realize his own powers.
[<i>Tensely.</i>] Oh, please, can’t you understand? I’m trying to do the one
thing a woman can do for a man.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>[<i>He has come to a decision and now breaks in</i>]. Mrs. Rabinowitz, let
me ask you a question.... When was the last time that Jack attended a
synagogue?</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>When he was confirmed. He was thirteen years old. He sang a solo in the
choir. It was beautiful.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>Mary, did he ever attend a synagogue during the time you have known him?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>Mrs. Rabinowitz, he ran away from all this, [<i>Indicates the room</i>]
didn’t he?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>[<i>Slowly</i>]. Why are you asking me like this questions?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>[<i>Crescendo</i>]. Because I want that boy to be true to himself. Do you
suppose the Cantor would want Jack to sing unless he sings with the
heart of a Jew? I know that boy. He’s saying to himself, “My career is
gone. The girl I love is losing faith in me. I don’t want to sing this
stuff that I don’t understand—to a God whose meaning I don’t get.” He’s
saying to himself, “My mother will be heartbroken if I don’t do it. My
father will die. That’s why I’ll do it.”</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>[<i>In a faint voice</i>]. No, no. You are telling me lies!</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>[Moved]. Harry—let’s go—can’t you see you are hurting—</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>[Rising to his climax]. Supposing the Cantor could see into Jack’s
heart? Do you know what he would see there? Jazz music, <i>nigger
music</i>—if you want to call it that. Do you think that would make him
happy?</p>

<p class="hindent2">[<i>The door opens and</i> <span class="smcap">Jack</span> <i>enters. The evening light has deepened.</i>
<span class="smcap">Jack</span>’s <i>face is white, his eyes burning black. There is a new quality

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Yes, Mama.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>I want you should tell me the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Yes, Mama.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>Jakie, I want you to do only what is in your heart. Answer me: Are you
singing tonight because you love me and your Papa and your God—because
you want to be in the Synagogue on the Day of Atonement—or is your
heart far away in theatres with jazz music?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>[<i>Turning upon</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lee</span>]. What are you people doing here—what
are you trying to do to me?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>I did, Jack.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>So did I.... Oh, Jack—don’t you understand? I love you. I love you
enough to be cruel to you for your sake. Oh, my dear, tell me that you
are true to yourself, and I’ll go. I’ll go and I’ll come back to you.
Tell me that you lied this afternoon when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span> you said that the only
real thing in your life was your career—tell me that you lied every
time you got up on the stage in that Madison Street movie house—</p>

<p>[<i>Turns on her with an effort</i>]. Mama, get ready. We’ll be late.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

<p>[<i>Mercilessly</i>]. All we want is the truth, Jack. When I came in
here—when I talked to you, didn’t you want to come back with me? <em>In
your heart didn’t you want to come back?</em></p>

<p class="cast_role">Mary</p>

<p>Jack—this afternoon, when you were talking to me, you told me—you said—</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>Jakie—did you <em>want</em> to come?</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>[<i>Sinks into chair. He is defeated</i>]. No.</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>[<i>Leans over him</i>]. And yet you came ... you came home ... and you was
singing with the choir....</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>Yes, I came home....</p>

<p>[<i>There is a silence</i>].</p>

<p class="cast_role">Sara</p>

<p>[<i>Her voice sings a hymn of sacrifice</i>]. It’s enough. I didn’t know
until today how different your life is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span> from your papa’s, from
mine. I didn’t understand that by you being a ragtime singer is like by
your papa being a Cantor.... Jakie—do what is in your heart.... Always
you can come back to me. I’m your mama.... But if you sing tonight
and God ain’t in your heart, your Papa he’ll know.... All his life
your papa loved God and the truth. Maybe if I tell your papa, he will
understand....</p>

<p class="cast_role">Jack</p>

<p>[<i>On the point of collapse. His voice is bitter, sardonic in defeat</i>].
Me a Cantor.... Funny—that’s what it is—funny.... I was just rehearsing
with the choir, and they were like strangers to me—the same little boys
that I used to play with—and they were strangers to me!... Sure! I’m
from uptown—Broadway.... Seemed like every one of them was pointing
his finger at me and saying, “Jakie Rabinowitz, jazz singer! Jakie
Rabinowitz, jazz singer!”...</p>

<p class="cast_role">Lee</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
